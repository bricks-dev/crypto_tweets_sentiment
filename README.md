# setup

1. Follow fastai's setup procedure, don't use `pip install fastai`, pull the github directory, this is because fastai is changing really fast.

fastai's conda environment has all the dependencies you will need.

2. There will be a fastai folder that conains the fastai library code that we need, copy this folder into the project folder.

This is the folder you want:

3. Make a `models` folder, the `.h5` files will be put into this directory

4. the `.pkl` file will be put into project directory

This is what my project folder looks like:
